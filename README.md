## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I struggle with `box-shadow` usually but today I think I finally understood its values a little.

### Continued development

I think I am good at flexbox now, so in the future I want to start using CSS Grid.
